# 🌿 Remedy

**Personalized rituals for real-life goals.**  
Remedy is a wellness app that adapts to you—not the other way around.

Whether you want:
- ✨ Long, healthy hair  
- 🌸 Glowing skin  
- 💪 Better energy  
- 🧠 Mental clarity  
- 🐣 Fertility support  

Remedy builds daily rituals with herbs, supplements, meals, and practices rooted in your **intention**, **diet**, and **lifestyle**.

## 🔧 What We're Building

- An adaptive interface using **[Tambo](https://tambo.co/)** that shifts based on your chosen goal
- Localization with **[Lingo](https://lingo.dev/)** so the experience meets you in your language
- Dynamic plans with optional **[Autumn](https://useautumn.com/)** pricing for deeper rituals
- Curated recommendations from natural health research, cultural wisdom, and community knowledge

## 💭 Why It Matters

Most health apps force everyone into one plan, one body, one definition of "wellness."

**Remedy** asks instead:  
> *What do you want to grow into?*

From there, it adapts.
